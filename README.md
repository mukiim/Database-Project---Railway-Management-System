# Database Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Database Project! This repository contains a comprehensive set of SQL scripts, database schemas, and entity-relationship diagrams for a robust database system. It's designed for educational purposes, demonstrating database design, query optimization, and trigger implementation.

## Contents
- **Database.sql:** The main SQL script for creating the database structure.
- **Queries.sql:** A collection of SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Trigger.sql:** SQL scripts for database triggers to automate certain operations.
- **ER.pdf/ER_1.pdf:** Entity-Relationship diagrams illustrating the database structure.
- **Schema.pdf:** Detailed schema diagram of the database.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- SQL server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- PDF viewer for ER and Schema diagrams

### Installation
1. Set up your SQL server.
2. Run `Database.sql` to create the database schema.
3. Execute `Queries.sql` and `Trigger.sql` as needed.

## Usage
Use the provided SQL scripts to explore database creation, manipulation, and triggers. The ER and Schema diagrams can be used as a reference for understanding the database structure.
